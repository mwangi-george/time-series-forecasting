Hi there! I’m [**George Mwangi**](https://github.com/mwangi-george), a software engineer and data professional specializing in the intersection of machine learning, data analytics, and digital health systems. My work focuses on building practical, **production-ready solutions** for forecasting, decision support, and data-driven planning.

I am particularly interested in applying modern data science tools to solve real-world business challenges and public health sector problems.

### Technical Arsenal

I bridge the gap between large-scale data processing and modern web architecture using a specialized stack:

-   **Data & Backend:** Expert-level **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**. I build high-performance APIs and backends using **FastAPI** and **GraphQL**.

-   **Frontend & Interactivity:** I craft responsive user interfaces using **TypeScript** and **React**, and I specialize in rapid-prototyping data dashboards with **RShiny**.

-   **Domain Expertise:** Digital Health Systems (DHIS2 integration, health informatics), Machine Learning deployment, and Predictive Modeling.

### My Blogs

In my free time, I am a firm believer in the "Learn in Public" philosophy. I love to share the knowledge I’ve acquired over the years to help fellow engineers and data professionals navigating similar paths. I write to turn complex technical hurdles into clear, actionable roadmaps for others. You can explore my blog posts below.
